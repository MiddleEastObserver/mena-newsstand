"""Decides what each workflow run should do, using the reliable 30-min trigger
as a clock instead of GitHub's flaky `schedule` events.

Every run:
  - Fetch headlines (always, handled by the workflow itself)

Every 6 hours (slots 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 Israel time — first run
after each boundary):
  - DO_BRIEFING=true  → build_briefing.py writes briefing.json
  - DO_EMAIL=true     → send_email.py sends the digest

Once a day at ~07:00 Israel time (morning):
  - DO_FRONTPAGES=true (full refresh) → fetch_frontpages.py downloads today's
    covers; titles not yet scanned upstream fall back to yesterday's edition.

Once a day at ~14:00 Israel time (afternoon):
  - DO_FRONTPAGES=true (full refresh) → fetch_frontpages.py (catches re-plates)

Between those, on every ~30-min run after the morning grab:
  - DO_FRONTPAGES=true + FRONTPAGES_FILL_ONLY=true → re-fetch ONLY the papers
    still showing an older edition, so each title upgrades to today's cover
    within one cycle of appearing upstream instead of waiting for 14:00. This
    stops firing once every cover is current (frontpages_stale() → False).

"Once per slot/day" is enforced with state/daily.json. Times are in
Asia/Jerusalem so DST is handled automatically.
